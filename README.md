# NoNotation

The ambition of this package is to provide a mathematical notation(*) which can be safely applied to any article encompassing any math topics, without introducing ambiguities. Currently focuses more on computer science-centered topics, more are being added as the package evolves.

(\*) By definition a 'notation' is an *arbitrary* set of symbols, each given a specific meaning in a particular domain of interest, in order to facilitate communication within such domain. I wish for the *arbitrariness* to be disposed of, applying a combination of common knowledge and readability principles, and maximizing symbol reuse where it makes sense (a good example is the membership symbol).
